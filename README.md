Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a classification model that can accurately predict and classify the side effects of a specific drug based on the age, gender, and race of the patients.

Introduction

Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful and versatile approach with applications spanning across various domains, including classification, prediction, and forecasting. Its potential has been realized in fields such as medicine, engineering, education, manufacturing, and traffic management etc. Particularly in the pharmaceutical and medical sectors, Ml has proven instrumental in leveraging diverse datasets for improved analysis, prevention, and treatment.
Unleashing the power of machine learning in health care, we redefined treatment precision, personalized care, and unlocked new possibilities. With real-time patient data, drug side effects are classified with accuracy, empowering smarter decisions for better outcomes. Discover the future health care, where innovation meets value-based care. 
Side effects are unwanted effects that can occur alongside the desired effects of a drug or medication. They vary based on factors like age, disease, gender, race, and health. Starting, changing, or stopping medication can trigger side effects leading to non-compliance. Severe cases may require dosage adjustments or additional medication. Lifestyle changes can help minimize side effects. Classifying side effects for each drug is challenging, but machine learning eases the process while maintaining accuracy. Research reveals differences in drug response among racial and ethnic groups, emphasizing the need for inclusive treatment policies that accommodates individual needs.
For this project, a dataset of drug effects which has been provided in the digital discussion room has been used. As this dataset lacked ’Name’, ‘Race’, ‘Gender’, and ‘Age’ features, these were randomly generated using Faker Python Module and then concatenated with it. The mastered dataset featured 10 columns and 4,00,000 rows.
The dataset used for classification include drugs name, age etc. of different users of drugs. These can be analyzed to find side effects of drugs with the help of machine learning algorithms. Here, the machine is trained with data using various algorithms. After training the machine predicts the output against unseen inputs. Supervised machine learning classifiers are used in building the model and fitting the data into the model.

Conclusion

This project involved cleaning and analyzing the dataset on drug usage and its effects. The Decision tree classifier performed best in predicting drug usage patterns with 95.55% accuracy. Senior adults aged 60-100 used the drug the most, and users generally found it highly effective. Individual differences in drug side effects were noted, influenced by their bodies and race. The findings offer valuable insights into drug consumption trends and can help optimize treatments for diverse patient populations, contributing to better healthcare outcomes.
