Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a classification model that can accurately predict and classify the side effects of a specific drug based on the age, gender, and race of the patients.

Introduction

Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful and versatile approach with applications spanning across various domains, including classification, prediction, and forecasting. Its potential has been realized in fields such as medicine, engineering, education, manufacturing, and traffic management etc. Particularly in the pharmaceutical and medical sectors, Ml has proven instrumental in leveraging diverse datasets for improved analysis, prevention, and treatment.
Unleashing the power of machine learning in health care, we redefined treatment precision, personalized care, and unlocked new possibilities. With real-time patient data, drug side effects are classified with accuracy, empowering smarter decisions for better outcomes. Discover the future health care, where innovation meets value-based care. 
Side effects are unwanted effects that can occur alongside the desired effects of a drug or medication. They vary based on factors like age, disease, gender, race, and health. Starting, changing, or stopping medication can trigger side effects leading to non-compliance. Severe cases may require dosage adjustments or additional medication. Lifestyle changes can help minimize side effects. Classifying side effects for each drug is challenging, but machine learning eases the process while maintaining accuracy. Research reveals differences in drug response among racial and ethnic groups, emphasizing the need for inclusive treatment policies that accommodates individual needs.
For this project, a dataset of drug effects which has been provided in the digital discussion room has been used. As this dataset lacked ’Name’, ‘Race’, ‘Gender’, and ‘Age’ features, these were randomly generated using Faker Python Module and then concatenated with it. The mastered dataset featured 10 columns and 4,00,000 rows.
The dataset used for classification include drugs name, age etc. of different users of drugs. These can be analyzed to find side effects of drugs with the help of machine learning algorithms. Here, the machine is trained with data using various algorithms. After training the machine predicts the output against unseen inputs. Supervised machine learning classifiers are used in building the model and fitting the data into the model.

Conclusion

In this project, the main focus was on cleaning and analyzing a dataset concerning drug usage and its effects. The Decision tree classifier proved to be the most effective among the evaluated machine learning models, with an impressive 95.55% accuracy in predicting drug usage patterns. It was observed that senior adults aged 60-100 were the primary users of the drug, and overall, it was considered highly effective by the users. Additionally, the analysis revealed individual variations in drug side effects, which seemed to be influenced by factors such as their physiological characteristics and race. These insights can be highly beneficial in optimizing treatments for diverse patient populations, leading to improved healthcare outcomes. Moreover, the dataset underscored the prevalence of medication usage for mental health conditions like depression and insomnia, outweighing that for physical health conditions.
